6000B_project2_transfer
In this project, you are required to train a deep model and then test on a test set including 5 kinds of flowers.
Data set is avaiable on Dropbox:  data.zip download
There are 3 txt files stroring the pathes of training data, validation data and test data respectively.
Each line in train.txt and val.txt corresponds to a data sample's path and label, which are splited by a space. The format: $PAT:H $LABEL
Each line in test.txt corresponds to a data sample's path only. The format: $PATH
You need to train a deep model on the training set.
You need to predict the class labels of the test data points whose pathes are stored in test.txt.
The prediction of your model on the test dataset should be stored in a txt file.
Each line stores the predicted class label for the corresponding test data point in test.txt. The format:$LABEL
The file name of the txt file should be project2_student id.
For example, if your student id is 10001, then the txt file should be named 'project2_10001.txt'.
You have to submit a 1-2 page report in a pdf file on what model you used and additional operations you made.
The file name of the pdf file should be project2_student id_report.
For example, if your student id is 10001, then the txt file should be named 'project2_10001_report.pdf'.
Grading will be based on the testing accuracy.
Due date: 11:59pm, Nov 23, 2017.
You need to put the source code, your prediction (in csv file) and report (in pdf file) in Github. Then email your Github link to WANG Weiyan, the TA for this course, via wwangbc@cse.ust.hk before the deadline.
For enquries, please contact the TA.
